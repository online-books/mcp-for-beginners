# 🚀 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Curriculum for Beginners

## **Learn MCP with Hands-on Code Examples in C#, Java, JavaScript, Rust, Python, and TypeScript**

## 🧠 Overview of the Model Context Protocol Curriculum
Welcome to your journey into the Model Context Protocol! If you don ever wonder how AI applications dey communicate with different tools and services, you dey about to discover the fine solution wey dey change how developers de build intelligent systems.

Think of MCP as a universal translator for AI applications - just like how USB ports dey allow you connect any device to your computer, MCP dey allow AI models connect to any tool or service in one correct standard way. Whether na your first time to build chatbot or you dey work on complex AI workflows, to sabi MCP go give you power to create beta and flexible applications.

Dis curriculum get plenty patience and care for your learning journey. We go start with simple simple concepts wey you don sabi before and slowly build your level through hands-on practice for your favorite programming language. Every step get clear explanations, practical examples, and plenty encouragement along di way.

By the time you finish dis journey, you go don get confidence to build your own MCP servers, join dem with popular AI platforms, and understand how dis technology dey reshape future of AI development. Make we start this better adventure together!

### Official Documentation and Specifications

Dis curriculum align with **MCP Specification 2025-11-25** (di latest stable version). Di MCP specification dey use date-based versioning (YYYY-MM-DD format) so you fit track di protocol version well.

Dem resources dey more valuable as you sabi pass, but no pressure yourself to read everything quick-quick. Start with the areas wey interest you most!
- 📘 [MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) – Na dis one be your go-to resource for step-by-step tutorials and user guides. Documentation write am well for beginners, get clear examples wey you fit follow at your own pace.
- 📜 [MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25) – Think am like comprehensive reference manual. As you dey do the curriculum, you go dey come back here to check specific details and learn advanced features.
- 📜 [MCP Specification Versioning](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/versioning) – Dis one get info about protocol version history and how MCP dey use date-based versioning (YYYY-MM-DD format).
- 🧑‍💻 [MCP GitHub Repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) – Here you fit find SDKs, tools, and code samples for many programming languages. E be like treasure house of practical examples and ready-to-use components.
- 🌐 [MCP Community](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions) – Join fellow learners and experienced developers for discussions about MCP. Na supportive community wey questions dey welcome and knowledge dey share freely.
  
## Learning Objectives

By the end of dis curriculum, you go feel confident and excited about your new skills. Dis na wetin you go achieve:

• **Understand MCP fundamentals**: You go understand wetin Model Context Protocol be and why e dey change how AI applications dey work together, using analogies and examples wey make sense.

• **Build your first MCP server**: You go fit create MCP server wey dey work for your programming language, starting with simple examples and improve your skills step by step.

• **Connect AI models to real tools**: You go learn how to join AI models with real services, make your applications get strong beta capabilities.

• **Implement security best practices**: You go understand how to secure your MCP implementations well, protect your applications and users.

• **Deploy with confidence**: You go sabi how to take your MCP projects from development to production, with practical ways wey dey work for real world.

• **Join the MCP community**: You go become part of growing community wey dey shape future of AI application development. 

## Essential Background

Before we enter MCP details, make sure you dey comfortable with some basic concepts. No worry if you no be expert for these areas - we go explain everything wey you need to know as we go!

### Understanding Protocols (The Foundation)

Think protocol like rules for conversation. When you call your friend, una go know say if person talk "hello" when una answer, una go take turns to talk, and say "goodbye" when una finish. Computer programs need similar rules to talk well.

MCP na protocol - set of agreed rules wey help AI models and applications to get correct "conversation" with tools and services. Just like how rules for conversation make human communication smooth, MCP rules dey make AI app communication plenty reliable and powerful.

### Client-Server Relationships (How Programs Work Together)

You dey use client-server relationships every day! When you use browser (client) to visit website, you dey join web server wey go send you page content. Browser sabi how to ask information, server sabi how to respond.

For MCP, e dey similar: AI models act as clients wey dey ask for info or actions, MCP servers dey provide those things. E be like helpful assistant (server) wey AI fit ask to do specific work.

### Why Standardization Matters (Making Things Work Together)

Imagine if every car maker use different shape gas pump - you go need different adapter for every car! Standardization mean say everybody agree on common way so things go fit work together smooth.

MCP na di standardization wey AI applications need. No need say every AI model go need custom code to work with every tool, MCP create universal way to talk. Nke mean say developers fit build tools one time and e go work with many AI systems.

## 🧭 Your Learning Path Overview

Your MCP journey dey well structured to build your confidence and skills step by step. Every phase go introduce new concepts while e still reinforce wetin you don sabi.

### 🌱 Foundation Phase: Understanding the Basics (Modules 0-2)

Na here your adventure begin! We go show you MCP concepts using analogies wey you sabi and simple examples. You go understand wetin MCP be, why e dey exist, and how e take fit inside large world of AI development.

• **Module 0 - Introduction to MCP**: We go start by exploring wetin MCP be and why e important for modern AI applications. You go see real-world examples of MCP work and understand how e solve common problems wey developers dey face.

• **Module 1 - Core Concepts Explained**: Here you go learn important building blocks of MCP. We go use plenty analogies and clear examples to make sure say concepts straight and easy to understand.

• **Module 2 - Security in MCP**: Security fit sound fear, but we go show you how MCP get built-in safety features and teach you best practices to protect your applications from start.

### 🔨 Building Phase: Creating Your First Implementations (Module 3)

Now fun don start! You go get hands-on experience to build actual MCP servers and clients. No worry - we go start simple and guide you through every step.
Dis module get plenty hands-on guides wey go make you practice for di programming language wey you like. You go create your first server, build client wey go connect to am, and even join popular development tools like VS Code.

Every guide get beta code examples, troubleshooting tips, and explanation why we dey make certain design choices. By di time you finish dis phase, you go get working MCP implementations wey you fit proud for!

### 🚀 Growing Phase: Advanced Concepts and Real-World Application (Modules 4-5)
